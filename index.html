          Goggins said "motivational speaker" is just his job title.[10]

<p>As an inspirational speaker, Goggins travels and speaks to sports teams. He has spoken to athletes from professional teams,</p>
<p>including the Atlanta Hawks and the Seattle Seahawks, as well as collegiate athletes from the Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan</p>
<p>university football programs.[10]</p>

<p>Entrepreneur Jesse Itzler, upon seeing Goggins perform at a 24-hour ultramarathon, called and hired Goggins to live with him</p>
<p>in his house for a month. Itzler wrote about his experience on a blog and later published the story as the book Living With A SEAL.[citation needed][15]</p>

<p>His self-help memoir, Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds, was released on December 4, 2018. In the book he refers to</p>
<p>the 40% rule, his belief that most of us only tap into 40% of our capabilities. The Audible version of this book has sat in the </p>
<p>Amazon best sellers list since day 1 with over 15,000 positive reviews.[16]</p>
